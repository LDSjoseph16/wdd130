        <p>I am Edgar Joseph Pelinggon! 28 Years old. My mission from 2016 to 2018 was one of the most meaningful
            experiences of my life. I felt inspired every day as I
            served and taught the Lord’s children, witnessing how His gospel brings light and change to people’s hearts.

        <p>The Banaue Rice Terraces teach us the value of hard work, unity, and respect for nature.
            Built by the Ifugao people over 2,000 years ago without modern tools, these terraces show how dedication and
            cooperation
            can create something lasting and beautiful. They remind us that when we work together in harmony with the
            land, we can
            build a sustainable future for generations to come.</p>
